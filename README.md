# OIBSIP
Welcome to my OIBSIP Internship repository! 🚀 This repository contains all the tasks I completed as part of my Tech Internship at Oasis Infobyte.
Overview

This repository includes three machine learning projects:

1-Iris Classification - Predicting the species of an iris flower based on its features.

2-Car Price Prediction - Estimating the price of a car based on various parameters.

3-Email Spam Classifier - Identifying spam emails

📝 Project Descriptions

1️⃣ Iris Classification 🌸

Used the famous Iris Dataset to classify iris flowers into three species.

Implemented using Scikit-Learn and used KNN.

Achieved high accuracy using Hyperparameter Tuning.

2️⃣ Car Price Prediction 🚗

Predicts the price of a car based on features like brand, model, mileage, etc.

Used Linear Regression and Lasso regression.

Trained on a dataset containing real-world car prices.

3️⃣ Email Spam Classifier 📧

Built an NLP-based model to classify emails as Spam or Ham.

Used TF-IDF Vectorization and Naïve Bayes Classifier.

Deployed using Streamlit and Heroku.

🚀 Deployment

The Email Spam Classifier will be  deployed on Heroku.
